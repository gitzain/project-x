## Motivation
90% of everything that is watched, read or listened to in America is controlled by 6 media companies; the rest of the world is really no different. The output of media companies is clearly bias towards their own agendas; this includes the news. Thus all traditional news organisations are flawed. 

Robots don't lie nor are they affected by the aforementioned biases, they simply do as they are programmed. This project aims to produce an automated news site. How will this site fulfil these aims:  
1. The news will be gathered from the most reilable traditional news outlets from across the world  
2. Similar stories will be amalgamated together to provide a fuller picture  
3. Only the facts will be extracted from the news articles    
4. The story is ranked in terms of importance based on people affected globally   
5. The story is categorized and tagged  
6. Finally, the story is summarized to make it easy to consume  

The project is open source to ensure it does exactly what it claims to do.
